# ngPortfolio-Boilerplate
A simple personal website boilerplate in AngularJS.

This Angular boilerplate template uses JSON as a sort of content management system. Instead of page content being hardcoded in HTML, it is stored in .json files for their respective pages (About, Gallery, Blog). Content can then be added or changed from the .json files like you might in a database solution, without affecting the HTML code.

The blog section could be expanded with routes, so that clicking an article will take you to the article's URL.
